  </header><h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="pdf-about">
      <p>Hi, my name is Denis.</p>

<p>I am a Systems Architect driven by the “first-principles” approach to engineering. While I have a deep background in business analysis and technical writing, I have transitioned into architecture by doing what I do best: building complex, functional systems from the ground up.</p>

<p>My technical intuition is rooted in the “pre-LLM” era, meaning my skills are built on a solid foundation of architectural fundamentals rather than prompt dependency. I leverage modern AI tools to accelerate my workflow, but I treat them with caution and scrutiny.</p>

<p>What I bring to a project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Architectural Ownership: I don’t just design on paper, I build. My recent work involves orchestrating multi-service environments using NATS, Python, and a variety of data tools.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mental Flexibility: I am tool-agnostic. I select the best stack for the task, so it can be a lean, independently hosted Postgres-based implementation or a massive AWS-based microservices mesh.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Efficiency-First Mindset: I thrive in environments that value technical excellence over corporate bureaucracy. I prefer building high-impact, “sovereign” systems that solve real-world problems without unnecessary overhead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Core Stack: NATS, Python (FastAPI/SQLAlchemy), PostgreSQL, Docker, and Strategic System Design.</p>

                    <p>At CompStak I am working on setting up a consistent documentation architecture across the company’s technical portfolio.

I created release notes template and process, and participated in defining other flows and processes. I also author and maintain API documentation, internal technical docs, runbooks, and other materials.</p>
