  </header><h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="pdf-about">
      <p>Hi, my name is Denis.</p>

<p>I am a Systems Architect driven by the “first-principles” approach to engineering. While I have a deep background in business analysis and technical writing, I have transitioned into architecture by doing what I do best: building complex, functional systems from the ground up.</p>

<p>My technical intuition is rooted in the “pre-LLM” era, meaning my skills are built on a solid foundation of architectural fundamentals rather than prompt dependency. I leverage modern AI tools to accelerate my workflow, but I treat them with caution and scrutiny.</p>

<p>What I bring to a project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Architectural Ownership: I don’t just design on paper, I build. My recent work involves orchestrating multi-service environments using NATS, Python, and a variety of data tools.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mental Flexibility: I am tool-agnostic. I select the best stack for the task, so it can be a lean, independently hosted Postgres-based implementation or a massive AWS-based microservices mesh.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Efficiency-First Mindset: I thrive in environments that value technical excellence over corporate bureaucracy. I prefer building high-impact, “sovereign” systems that solve real-world problems without unnecessary overhead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Core Stack: NATS, Python (FastAPI/SQLAlchemy), PostgreSQL, Docker, and Strategic System Design.</p>

                <p><strong>CompStak</strong>— Senior Technical Writer<br>July 2020 - Present<br>Link: <a href="https://compstak.com">https://compstak.com</a></p><div class="pdf-item-description">
                    <p>At CompStak I am working on setting up a consistent documentation architecture across the company’s technical portfolio. I maintain day-to-day documentation activities, assist with knowledge sharing, research new tools and approaches. I created release notes template and process, and participated in defining other flows and processes. I also author and maintain API documentation, internal technical docs, runbooks, and other materials.</p>

                    <p>This was a minor establishment that, however, provided solid foundation in history and generic social sciences. First two years 
I spent in Mykolaiv, in a local offshoot of the Uni, and in 2003 I moved to Kyiv to continue education. I recieved bachelor’s 
degree in 2005, and master’s - a year later.</p>

                    <p>I spent 2 years studying cinema in the workshop by Sergei Solovyov &amp; Valery Rubinchik (both - practicing film directors), and only 
quit due to lack of funding. I enrolled because I love movies, and always had a thing for writing. Though it didn’t work out for me,
I did acquire a number of foundational skills, and a few life-long friends.</p>

            <p>I build a project, which purpose is to collect, clean, and analyze data around a certain geographical slice of the media landscape.</p>

<p>As of beginning of 2026 the implementation consists of 12 applications (including dedicated orchestrator and data hub) that co-exist in the NATS-based system, with 9+ distinct cross-service flows among them. Technologies employed include website crawling (with and without LLMs), machine learning experiments (MLflow), OTel, HTTP endpoints with FastAPI, Telegram bots, various API integrations, as well as LLM-based determination of relevance (CrewAI).</p>

<p>If you wish to learn more, visit dedicated <a href="https://github.com/subjective-agency/warch">documentation repository</a>. Here you will find:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AsyncAPI specifications for all applications</li>
  <li>AsyncAPI specifications and diagrams for the cross-application flows</li>
  <li>Plain-language description of applications and initiatives</li>
  <li>Elaborate intentions for various features, both implemented and planned;</li>
</ul>

<p>and more.</p>
