  Hi, my name is Denis and I'm a big fan of event-driven architectures. I love to study them, and I love to build them.
  
  I started small, as a technical writer, and taught myself everything one needs to build interconnected and pulsing network.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>NATS</mark>, <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>databases</mark>

          Wapaganda is a coherent, multi-component system for analyzing media landscape around current Russo-Ukrainian war
          
          I started it for personal reasons, but also as a way to learn various technologies.
          
          The system is NATS-based, with over 10 different services working in concert to collect, process, and analyze data from multiple sources.
