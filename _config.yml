  Hi, my name is Denis. Thank you for visiting my page.
  
  I am an asipring systems architect. "Aspiring" means that most of my experience was accumulated outside my direct work responsibilities: 
  I built a complex system almost entirely on my own specifically as a means of ascending to the architect's level. See "Proof of skill" for details.
  In addition to various technical skills, I developed mental flexibility and technical intuition that allow me to select best tools for any 
  task regardless of my prior experience with them.

  Despite huble beginnings as a technical writer, I taught myself everything one needs to build interconnected networks, including **coding**, 
  **infrastructure**, **telemetry**, **event-driven way of thinking**, and so on.

  I started advancing myself **before** the LLM upheaval, so my skills are solid. I do use LLMs in my day-to-day, but I learned to do it with caution.

  I am best at: <mark>NATS</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>systemic thinking</mark>, <mark>databases</mark>

      I build 1 project titled "Wapaganda". Its purpose is to collect, clean, and analyze data around a _certain geographical slice_* of the media landscape.

      As of January 2026 the implementation consists of 12 applications (including dedicated orchestrator and data hub) that co-exist in the NATS-based system, 
      with 9+ distinct cross-service flows among them. Technologies employed include website crawling (with and without LLMs), machine learning experiments 
      (MLflow), OTel, HTTP endpoints with FastAPI, Telegram bots, various API integrations, as well as LLM-based determination of relevance (CrewAI).

      The code is located [here](https://github.com/subjective-agency/wapatools), but you would need an explicit invitation to see it. Apologies for this
      extra step, but it's necessary for now*.

          This was a minor establishment that, however, provided solid foundation in history and generic social sciences. First two years 
          I spent in Mykolaiv, in a local offshoot of the Uni, and in 2003 I moved to Kyiv to continue education. I recieved bachelor's 
          degree in 2005, and master's - a year later. 

        #   I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.

          I spent 2 years studying cinema in the workshop by Sergei Solovyov & Valery Rubinchik (both - practicing film directors), and only 
          quit due to lack of funding. I enrolled because I love movies, and always had a thing for writing. Though it didn't work out for me,
          I did acquire a number of foundational skills, and a few life-long friends.
