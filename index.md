### **Work Experience  \-::- 10 years**

| December 2020 \- April 2021 around 5 months | StageRoll |
| :---- | :---- |
|  | *Business analyst* |
|  | At StageRoll I was working on the discovery stage of a new product development \- preparation for PoC, MVP and further stages of the development pretty much simultaneously. This included diagrams of various kinds, written documentation and oral communication of knowledge to other members of the team. |
| November 2020- current | **Giggster** |
|  | *Data analysis & visualization specialist* |
|  | In my 2nd iteration with Giggster I’m working on the data accumulation and analysis project \- basically a custom ETL in its own right \- with a data visualization module (Python \+ Plotly \+ Dash) as its ultimate outlet. |
| July 2020 \- current | **CompStak** |
|  | *Senior Technical Writer* |
|  | At CompStak I am working on setting up a consistent documentation process, as well as maintaining day-to-day documentation activities and assisting with knowledge sharing. As a side-project I created an interactive dashboard (Python \+ Plotly \+ Dash) for internal purposes. |
| June 2020 \- January 2021 **around 6 months** | **Business Process Technology** |
|  | *Business analyst* |
|  | At BPT I was working on several projects, including in-house products, but mostly on the crypto-currency exchange Exchanger.ee, which I led from conception and almost to release. My responsibilities included elaboration of user stories and business use cases, mockup creation, documentation maintenance, requirements clarification etc. |
| March 2016 \- November 2019 **almost 4 years** | **Giggster**   |
|  | *Business analyst* |
|  | With Giggster my responsibilities included monitoring of the market (benchmark analysis); research of various aspects of the business operation; integration of the 3rd-party data into the system; writing technical documentation, including user stories and use cases; composing diagrams in UML notation; creating mockups; conducting interviews/maintaining relationships with stakeholders of different levels; etc. **Overlap with Postindustria/Jobjet**. |
| February 2016 \- November 2019 **almost 4 years**  | **Postindustria / Jobjet** |
|  | *Business analyst* |
|  | In February of 2016 I started collaborating as a business analyst on several projects at Postindustria; mostly on *Jobjet* and *Giggster*, two flagship products of the company. Here I sourced and procured quality databases for enrichment of the operational DBs; hired freelancers for particular sub-projects and managed their activity; coordinated active communications between different stakeholders within the company, as well as external ones; wrote technical documentation; etc. **Overlap with Giggster**. |
| January 2015 \- February 2016 **over a year** | **IQRIA** |
|  | *Business analyst | Technical writer*   |
|  | I was hired as a technical writer first, but soon enough the spectre of my responsibilities expanded to include mock-ups & wireframe design, communication with customers, as well as research of various aspects of business processes, and other stuff related to the product development activities. |
| March 2011 \- June 2014   **over 3 years** | **Moscow Translations Center**   |
|  | *Head of Translation Office* |
|  | During my work at the Moscow Translation Center I managed one of the translations offices in the city of Korolyov, Moscow region. Besides making sure that my office is working properly at all times, my responsibilities included actually performing the translations, keeping close contact with notary public, maintaining communications with a wide circle of freelance translators, and regular financial reporting. |

**Education** 

| I have obtained a Master’s Degree in *International Relationships* from *Kiev Slavonic University* in 2006\. Right after that I went to study cinema at the *Russian State University of Cinema in Moscow*, RF, but dropped out due to lack of financing (in 2008). Over the years I took a number of professional development activities, most of which resulted in just knowledge and skill but not formal documentation; I do, however, have a digital certificate from *Johns Hopkins University* for *“Data Science: Foundations using R Specialization”* course on Coursera. I learned SQL via*“SQL the Hard Way”* course and subsequent practice. I learned Python by sifting through countless on-line sources and practicing the acquired knowledge. |
